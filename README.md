# Chatbot  

This repository contains a political chatbot designed to engage users in meaningful discussions and provide insights on various political topics. Built using OpenAI's powerful APIs, the chatbot leverages advanced models to generate accurate and context-aware responses.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Language Model**:  
  - Embedding Model: `text-embedding-3-large`  
  - Completions Model: `gpt-4o`  
- **API**: OpenAI API for natural language processing and embeddings.  
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Dataset**: Regional election 2024 in Indonesia (not shared here)

## How It Works  
The chatbot operates by embedding user input using the `text-embedding-3-large` model to understand context. It then generates responses using the `gpt-4o` completions model, ensuring conversational depth and relevance.  

## Usage  
1. Start the chatbot and interact via the terminal or a connected UI.  
2. Ask political questions, discuss policies, or explore ideologies.  
3. The chatbot will provide well-reasoned responses based on the models' training.
